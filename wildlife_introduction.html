              A UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve,
              Sinharaja Forest Reserve is the last viable area of primary
              tropical rainforest in Sri Lanka featuring tumbling waterfalls,
              bubbling pools and emerald ferns. Situated in the south west of
              the island, the forest’s canopy towers up to 45m and astonishingly
              over two-thirds of the trees are endemic, many of them even
              considered rare. <br /><br />
              However, one of the main reasons to visit Sinharaja is for the
              excellent birdwatching. The reserve supports over 80% of the
              island’s bird species as well as being a habitat for endemic birds
              such as the green-billed coucal, the blue magpie and the red-faced
              malkoha. Butterflies, insects, amphibians and reptiles also live
              in this rich biodiverse reserve as well as mammals such as the
              rare leopard, purple-faced langur, rusty spotted cat and three
              types of squirrel.

              Udawalawe National Park just south of Sri Lanka's central
              mountains, is a large reserve made up of 119 square miles of
              grassland, scrub jungle and riverine forest. The main attraction
              of the park is the large concentration of Asian elephants found
              here, Udawalawe is home to over 400 of these gentle giants and it
              is almost guaranteed to see them whilst on safari. A favourite
              hangout for the herds of elephants is the Walawe Reservoir where
              the creatures come to drink during times of water scarcity.
              <br /><br />
              Udawalawe National Park is also home to some other exciting
              wildlife including the mugger crocodile, sambar, spotted and
              barking deer, wild boar, water buffalo and jackal whilst the
              birding is excellent with nearly 200 species recorded. November to
              March is the optimal time for birdwatching expeditions with the
              chance to spot exciting raptors such as the changeable hawk-eagle,
              serpent eagle and grey-headed fish eagle.

              Up in the central highlands, the Horton Plains measure up to an
              impressive 2,100 metres above sea level, making it the highest
              plateau in Sri Lanka and consequently named of the Roof of the
              Island. The plains comprise largely of cloud forest and lush
              montane grasslands which are rich in endemic plants and animals
              that have adapted to the cool climate.
              <br /><br />
              Whilst the elephant disappeared from this region back in the
              1940s, the Horton Plains are home to a wide variety of mammals,
              birds, amphibians and reptiles. The most common mammal seen is the
              sambar deer who skirts through the long grasses and moves in large
              herds. Giant squirrels, wild boars, rusty-spotted cats and
              purple-faced langurs are amongst some of the 24 species of mammal
              found here, and the Horton Plains slender loris, one of the
              world's most endangered primates, can also be found in the
              highlands. Rare lizard species such as the rhino-horned lizard
              reside in the cloud forests, and for bird enthusiasts there are
              both a huge range of migratory and endemic birds to watch.

              Declared a Nature Reserve in 1988 and then upgraded to national
              park status in 2002, the Hikkaduwa National Park in the southern
              province is one of only two marine national parks in Sri Lanka.
              Although the southern coastline is home to many coral reefs, the
              reefs in Hikkaduwa are the most diverse and accessible and offer
              some of the country's best snorkelling and diving opportunities.
              <br /><br />
              The main reef of Hikkaduwa sits in a sheltered lagoon, it is a
              typical fringing reef with an average depth of about 5 metres. The
              coral is colourful and diverse with around 60 different species
              including boulder and encrusting corals, small-strands of Acropora
              coral and the cabbage-like Montipora coral. The seagrass is home
              to sea turtles, whilst tropical reef fish such as parrot fish,
              angel fish and butterfly fish skirt through the corals. Along the
              outer slope of the reef, blacktip reef sharks can be found along
              with hawksbill and green turtles.

              Minneriya National Park sits in the north central province and
              with just over 300 square miles it remains one of the smallest
              parks in Sri Lanka. Despite the reserve’s small size, it is home
              to a range of terrains including grasslands and thick scrub, dry
              tropical forest and wetlands. Minneriya also features a man-made
              tank that filters to the reservoir and feeds the park’s wildlife
              during the dry months.
              <br /><br />
              Mammals found in Minneriya include deer, purple-faced langur and
              macaque monkeys, sloth bears and about 20 leopards, plus there is
              a wonderful range of migratory and indigenous birds throughout the
              park including the hanging parrot, brown-capped babbler and green
              bee-eater. However, the star attraction of the reserve is ‘The
              Gathering’; a spectacle where over 300 elephants congregate to the
              Minneriya reservoir as they search for water and fresh grass
              during the dry season (July – October). This wonderful event is
              the largest meeting of Asian elephants in the world.

              The Bundala National Park stretches over 20km of Sri Lanka’s south
              coast enclosing five shallow lagoons. The reserve is home to a
              wide range of terrain including scrub jungle, salt pans, sand
              dunes and wetlands which allows for a rich diversity of wildlife.
              The park’s beaches play habitat to all five species of turtle who
              lay their eggs here.
              <br /><br />
              Bundala is one of Sri Lanka’s finest places for birdwatching.
              Known for its incredible spectacles of migratory birds, the
              reserve’s lagoons also attract an amazing variety of aquatic
              birds. The pink greater flamingo is one of the park’s more famous
              visitors and huge flocks of flamingos migrate here from Northern
              India. Other aquatic birds include the pelican, ibis, painted
              stork and spoonbill. The beautiful peafowl can also be widely
              spotted as well as a range of endemic birds. In terms of other
              wildlife, visitors are likely to spot excited troops of grey
              langur monkeys, crocodiles sunning themselves and wild pigs
              foraging.
