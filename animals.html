      <h3>
        Sri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, is home to a diverse array of
        indigenous animals, many of which are endemic, meaning they are found
        nowhere else in the world. The country's unique geographical features,
        including forests, wetlands, and coastal areas, contribute to this
        biodiversity.

        known for its striking spotted coat. Yala National Park is particularly
        famous for leopard sightings. Conservation efforts are in place to
        protect this endangered species and its habitat.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus):</h3>
      <p class="ani-para-3">

        monkey found in the island's montane forests. It is recognized by its
        distinctive purple face, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect
        its diminishing habitat.
