        <h2>Wilpattu National Park:</h2>
        <p>
          Location: Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri Lanka, located
          in the northwest part of the country.<br />
          Habitat: The park is characterized by a mix of natural lakes, dense
          scrublands, and open grasslands, providing an ideal environment for
          leopards to thrive. <br />Leopard Population: Wilpattu is known for
          its healthy population of leopards, and the park has been a
          significant conservation area for this species. <br />Unique Feature:
          Wilpattu is distinctive for its "villus" or natural lakes, which add
          to the overall beauty of the park and provide a source of water for
          the diverse wildlife.

        <h2>Udawalawe National Park:</h2>
        <p>
          Location: Situated in the southern part of Sri Lanka, Udawalawe
          National Park is known for its scenic landscapes. <br />
          Habitat: The park consists of grasslands, scrublands, and forests
          surrounding the Udawalawe Reservoir, creating an environment that
          supports a variety of wildlife. <br />Leopard Population: While
          Udawalawe is more famous for its elephant population, leopards are
          also present in the park. However, leopard sightings are relatively
          less common compared to other species. <br />Wildlife Viewing:
          Udawalawe is popular for its elephant safaris, but visitors may also
          have the chance to spot leopards and other wildlife during their
          visit.

      <h2>1. Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:</h2>
      <img src="./Image/leopards/habitat loss 3.webp" alt="" />
      <h3>Threat Description:</h3>
      <p>
        Habitat loss and fragmentation pose a significant threat to leopard
        populations in Sri Lanka. Rapid urbanization, agricultural expansion,
        and infrastructure development have led to the destruction and
        fragmentation of the leopards' natural habitats.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Consequences:</h3>
      <p>
        The reduction of suitable habitats forces leopards into smaller and
        isolated areas, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict,
        inbreeding, and a decline in prey availability. Habitat loss also
        disrupts ecological balance, impacting other species within the
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Mitigation Mechanisms:</h3>

      <p>
        Protected Areas: Expansion and proper management of existing protected
        areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, help provide secure
        habitats for leopards. Corridor Establishment: Creating wildlife
        corridors connecting fragmented habitats allows leopards to move between
        areas, promoting genetic diversity and maintaining healthy populations.
        Land-use Planning: Implementing sustainable land-use practices and
        incorporating wildlife-friendly measures in development plans to
        minimize the impact on leopard habitats.

      <h2>2. Human-Wildlife Conflict:</h2>
      <img src="./Image/leopards/habitat loss 2.webp" alt="" />
      <h3>Threat Description:</h3>
      <p>
        As human populations expand into leopard habitats, conflicts between
        humans and leopards increase. These conflicts arise due to livestock
        depredation, threats to human safety, and retaliatory killings by
        communities.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Consequences:</h3>
      <p>
        Human-wildlife conflict not only endangers leopard populations but also
        poses risks to human lives. Retaliatory killings and poaching further
        exacerbate the decline of leopard numbers.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Mitigation Mechanisms:</h3>

      <p>
        Community Outreach and Education: Educating local communities about
        leopard behavior, promoting coexistence, and providing information on
        securing livestock can reduce conflicts. Livestock Protection Measures:
        Implementing measures such as secure enclosures and community-based
        predator-proofing techniques helps safeguard livestock and reduces the
        incentive for retaliatory killings. Early Warning Systems: Developing
        and implementing early warning systems to alert communities about
        leopard presence, allowing them to take preventive measures and avoid
        confrontations. Compensation Schemes: Establishing fair and efficient
        compensation schemes for livestock losses due to leopard predation helps
        alleviate economic burdens on local communities, fostering tolerance
        toward leopards.

        Addressing these threats requires a holistic approach that combines
        conservation efforts, community engagement, and sustainable development
        practices to ensure the long-term survival of leopard populations in Sri
        Lanka.
