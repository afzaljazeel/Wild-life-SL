    "threats1":[
      {
        "threatName1": " Habitat loss and fragmentation pose a significant threat to leopard populations in Sri Lanka. Rapid urbanization, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development have led to the destruction and fragmentation of the leopards' natural habitats."
      },
      {
        "threatName2": "The reduction of suitable habitats forces leopards into smaller and isolated areas, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict, inbreeding, and a decline in prey availability. Habitat loss also disrupts ecological balance, impacting other species within the ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "threatName3": "Protected Areas: Expansion and proper management of existing protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, help provide secure habitats for leopards. Corridor Establishment: Creating wildlife corridors connecting fragmented habitats allows leopards to move between areas, promoting genetic diversity and maintaining healthy populations. Land-use Planning: Implementing sustainable land-use practices and incorporating wildlife-friendly measures in development plans to minimize the impact on leopard habitats."

    "threats2":[
      {
        "threatName11": "As human populations expand into leopard habitats, conflicts between humans and leopards increase. These conflicts arise due to livestock depredation, threats to human safety, and retaliatory killings by communities."
      },
      {
        "threatName22": " Human-wildlife conflict not only endangers leopard populations but also poses risks to human lives. Retaliatory killings and poaching further exacerbate the decline of leopard numbers."

      {
        "threatName33": "Community Outreach and Education: Educating local communities about leopard behavior, promoting coexistence, and providing information on securing livestock can reduce conflicts. Livestock Protection Measures: Implementing measures such as secure enclosures and community-based predator-proofing techniques helps safeguard livestock and reduces the incentive for retaliatory killings. Early Warning Systems: Developing and implementing early warning systems to alert communities about leopard presence, allowing them to take preventive measures and avoid confrontations. Compensation Schemes: Establishing fair and efficient compensation schemes for livestock losses due to leopard predation helps alleviate economic burdens on local communities fostering tolerance toward leopards."
